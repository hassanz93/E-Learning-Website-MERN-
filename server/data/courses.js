  "title": "Quantum Mechanics",
  "description": "This course covers the experimental basis of quantum physics. Topics include: photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, photons, Franck-Hertz experiment, the Bohr atom, electron diffraction, de Broglie waves, and the wave-particle duality of matter and light. Introduction to wave mechanics: Schrödinger's equation, wave functions, wave packets, probability amplitudes, stationary states, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and zero-point energies. Solutions to Schrödinger's equation in one dimension: transmission and reflection at a barrier, barrier penetration, potential wells, the simple harmonic oscillator. Schrödinger's equation in three dimensions: central potentials and introduction to hydrogenic systems.",

      "title": "The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: Proof/Explanation! #3",
      "description": "In this video, I derive and discuss the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, perhaps one of the most famous relationships in Quantum Mechanics. I start by using the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (derived here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgkWU...) to determine the commutator of the position and momentum operators whose expressions I found in the previous video (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egu4i...).Once I derive the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, I devote much of the video to explaining what it means - *that it's a statement on the fundamental nature of quantum mechanical particles which arises from certain mathematical principles (e.g. Fourier Transforms) describing those particles*. In the video, I state that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle 'is a consequence of mathematics', but keep in mind that this mathematics is used to model quantum mechanical particles. Thus, in the context of Quantum Mechanics, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is a physical fact that can be derived mathematically (that's what I mean when I say 'consequence of mathematics').Towards the end of the video, I emphasize that the Uncertainty Principle is NOT a statement about observer-induced limitations on measurements; that's the Observer Effect.",
